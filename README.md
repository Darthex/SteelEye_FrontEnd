## Fixed the following issues

1.  In the title of the header, it displays `5 orders` but there are `6 orders` in the table. We want to display the `total` number of `orders` in the header title **(Solved)**

2.  In the table order submitted date is missing, we have timestamp data included in the `src\assets\timeStamps.json` with the corresponding ids, please combine that with the order data and make sure the order submitted date is being displayed in the table **(Solved)**

3.  Order Volume cell is displaying USD values, can you please make it display the currency value selected on the dropdown located in the header of the dashboard **(Solved)**

4.  Can you please add search feature on the order IDs with the search bar given in the header **(Solved)**

5.  Please clear the console errors and warnings. **(Solved)**

6.  When user selects an order, can you populate the Card on top of the listing component as shown in the image **(Solved)**


## StoryBook

1. Please add storybook to one of the components **(Tried)**
